(** Module [Lwt_tracing]: provides trace events. *)

(** This module allows a trace event handler to be registered. This
    will be notified whenever significant events happen to a thread.
*)

type thread_id = int64
  (** When Lwt is compiled with tracing support, every thread gets a unique ID. *)

type thread_type =
  | Wait
  | Task
  | Bind
  | Try

  | Join

type tracer = {
  note_created : thread_id -> thread_type -> unit;
  (** [note_created p] indicates when a new thread is created. *)

  note_read : thread_id -> unit;
  (** [note_reads p] indicates that the current thread read the resolution of p.
   * e.g. we were waiting for p and p has become resolved.
   * [note_read] implies [note_switch], even if it's not sent, so check [current_id]. *)

  note_resolved : thread_id -> ex:exn option -> unit;
  (** [note_resolves p] indicates that [p] has been resolved (woken).
   * If it resolved to failure, the exception is given too. *)

  note_becomes : thread_id -> thread_id -> unit;
  (** [note_becomes p1 p2] indicates that the previously-unresolved p1 now behaves as p2. *)

  note_label : thread_id -> string -> unit;
  (** Record a meaningful name for a thread. *)

  note_switch : unit -> unit;
  (** The current thread has changed. *)

  note_suspend : unit -> unit;
  (** The whole application is going to sleep (e.g. calling select()).
   * Call [note_switch] on resume. *)
}

val null_tracer : tracer
  (** A tracer that ignores all events. *)

val tracer : tracer ref
  (** The current tracer. Defaults to [null_tracer]. *)
